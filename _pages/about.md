Hi! My name is Lisa, and I am a PhD Student in the field of Empirical Aesthetics. Currently pursuing my doctoral degree at KU Leuven, my research revolves around investigating the perceptual organization of images of everyday scenes and artworks. With a keen interest in Open Science, Interdisciplinary research, and Science Communication, I am driven by the curiosity to unravel the complexities of what drives our aesthetic judgements.
