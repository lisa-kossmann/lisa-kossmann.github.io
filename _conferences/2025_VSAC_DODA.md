Stimulus selection is a critical first step in the empirical and computational
investigation of vision and art. While many image and stimulus sets have been curated
and published alongside valuable data, it can be difficult to find the best set for one’s
own research, as they often differ in various aspects and are shared across different
platforms. Therefore, we present a Database of Datasets for Aesthetics (DODA), an
intuitive Web Application in which researchers can browse all important datasets for
aesthetics research, with annotated properties that are highly relevant for their
possible suitability.
Based on a systematic review of stimulus sets in aesthetics, DODA offers a centralized
search system, intended to promote open-science oriented research practices.
Currently, DODA encompasses over 50 datasets, with a link to their location on the
web. We compare the datasets and document relevant selection criteria, such as Size,
Number of Participants, Participants per Stimulus, Research Question, Rating Scales,
Stimulus Source, Resolution, Homogeneity, etc. The information is displayed in a table
for users to easily filter through, prioritizing the criteria most important to them.
DODA also provides a wide range of quantitative image properties (QIPs) computed for
all datasets for users to download.
Reusing a dataset is not only ecological for the researcher and environment, but it also
allows for the comparison of different variables across the same stimulus set,
increasing our collective understanding of aesthetic appreciation. Working on the same
datasets provides a feasible opportunity to directly and indirectly collaborate across
methodologies within aesthetics. For DODA to grow alongside the field of aesthetics,
we encourage researchers to suggest other aesthetics datasets to be included in the
future.
DODA is part of the Aesthetics Toolbox, which encompasses useful tools like image
resizing and calculating QIPs to make aesthetics research on digital stimuli more
accessible and reproducible
