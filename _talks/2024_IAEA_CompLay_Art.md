While Composition has been at the center of philosophical aesthetics, art-theoretical
discussions, and art education, it has received considerably less attention in empirical
aesthetics. The same is true for the notion of Spatial Layout (hereafter “Layout”), which is
more central in the literature on space and scene perception. With this large preregistered
(https://osf.io/67mx5) online study of 160 artworks, we aim to provide a foundation for future
work by investigating the relationship of important aesthetic measures, namely Pleasure,
Interest, Order, and Complexity, with Composition and Layout. Our participants were
randomly assigned either the Composition or the Layout condition, received definitions and
examples of good and poor Composition or clear and unclear Layout, and then viewed 50
randomly selected artworks in two blocks. In the first block they rated them on either Pleasure
or Interest, either Order or Complexity, and either Composition or Layout, using 7-point
Likert Scales. In the second block they rated the same images again (new random order) on
Composition or Layout and on the two remaining aesthetic concepts. Participants also filled
out a standard demographics questionnaire, an art-experience questionnaire and scales from
selected personality questionnaires for Openness to Experience, Need for Closure, Sensation
Seeking and Aesthetic Sensitivity. First results (N=494) show that high ratings for
Composition and Layout lead to higher Pleasure ratings. Ratings for Order are highly
positively correlated with ratings for Composition and Layout, while ratings for Complexity
are negatively correlated with ratings for Composition and Layout. Participants scoring high
on Openness and Sensation Seeking require lower scores on Composition and Layout to give
higher Pleasure ratings. Composition and Layout are correlated higher for representative
artworks than for abstract artworks, and their relationship with other concepts seems to be
slightly different. Data collection is still ongoing until we have ratings from 1280 participants.
