When several multistable displays are viewed simultaneously, their perception is synchronized, as they tend to be in the same
perceptual state. Here, we investigated the possibility that perception may reflect embedded statistical knowledge of physical
interaction between objects for specific combinations of displays and layouts. We used a novel display with two ambiguously
rotating gears and an ambiguous walker-on-a-ball display. Both stimuli produce a physically congruent perception when an
interaction is possible (i.e., gears counterrotate, and the ball rolls under the walker’s feet). Next, we gradually manipulated the
stimuli to either introduce abrupt changes to the potential physical interaction between objects or keep it constant despite changes
in the visual stimulus. We characterized the data using four different models that assumed (1) independence of perception of the
stimulus, (2) dependence on the stimulus’s properties, (3) dependence on physical configuration alone, and (4) an interaction
between stimulus properties and a physical configuration. We observed that for the ambiguous gears, the perception was
correlated with the stimulus changes rather than with the possibility of physical interaction. The perception of walker-on-a-
ball was independent of the stimulus but depended instead on whether participants responded about a relative motion of two
objects (perception was biased towards physically congruent motion) or the absolute motion of the walker alone (perception was
independent of the rotation of the ball). None of the two experiments supported the idea of embedded knowledge of physical
interaction.
